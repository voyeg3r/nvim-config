==fixing audacious open folders error==
I don't know how it happened but when, eg, I plug in a USB drive or try to open a folder in a firefox extension (or other programs that want to open a folder...), it always wants to open with Audacious which is obnoxious.  Browsing through in Nautilus works fine and normal, but I want to know if I can find out how to get rid of the association with Audacious.

    I've tried deleting ~/.config and ~/.local to no help...

    Create the file

    ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list

    and fill it with

    [Default Applications]
    inode/directory=nautilus.desktop;

== setting gnome screenshot dir ==

  gsettings set org.gnome.gnome-screenshot auto-save-directory "file:///home/$USER/pictures/"

==setando o muse para ser destacado com o ctrl ou não==

  gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.mouse locate-pointer false

== accessing ssh throug nautilus ==

    sftp://user@address/folder/

-------------------------------
 disable most recent files view --> recently-used-xbel
-------------------------------

Put the following in ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini (create the file if it doesn’t exist):

        [Settings]
        gtk-recent-files-max-age=0
        gtk-recent-files-limit=0

    Then, remove the file holding recently-used data:

        rm ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel

Disabling tracer system

    tracker-control

= other stuff =

Put this in your /etc/environment

    BROWSER=/usr/bin/firefox
    CLUTTER_PAINT=disable-clipped-redraws:disable-culling
    export CLUTTER_VBLANK=none

If you had customized /etc/sysctl.conf, you need to rename it as /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf. If you had e.g. /etc/sysctl.d/foo, you need to rename is to /etc/sysctl.d/foo.conf


== solving the problem of hidden files by default ==

	open terminal and type:
