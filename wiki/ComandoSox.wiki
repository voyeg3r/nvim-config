== Normalising audio with sox ==
https://www.learnosity.com/blog/2009/11/normalising-audio-with-sox/

sox before.wav -n stat -v

This will return a number like: 4.234

You can then call sox again using this number:

sox -v 4.234 before.wav after.wav

And if you're feeling particularly good you can put the whole command on a single line as follows:

sox -v `sox before.wav -n stat -v 2>&1` before.wav after.wav
