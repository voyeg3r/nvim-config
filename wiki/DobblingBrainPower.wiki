dobbling your brain power

The title this section is dobbling your brain power
and this is porheps the most exciting section we had
the oporuntinity to talk about, and it's based in our
undestanding, based in our discovery that every human
been is born as genius,

every single one of us have an
enourmous untop reserves of creativity which we
ability fail to use, and the porpouse this section is
explaint to you some of aspects of you oun creativity
and show you how to get far far more out of yourself .
We know that in terms of goal setting, in terms of the
planing for the future, in terms of our aspirations for incomming
things you we are accomplish,

have you can never have any more
that you have today simply sweeting harder, the old days where
the basic rule was, that's you work harder and harder and you
hammer away if you want getting results what you did work hard still
have been past over, and today we know that we live in totaly creative
world, and every thing we have today is as result of the eficiency
which we use our minds, **** this before and everything we have
tomorow is going be as result as how we use our creative capacity

The ammount of creativity we use is very close connected to ourself
concept in to our attitudes toward ourselves as creative persons, every
child is born with remarkable aspects of creativity, is a manufactory
in some of the studies they look that they find 99% of the chindren
tested between the ages two and four tested out as hightly creative,
hightly creative and they are imaginative, they'r inovativ they'r curious
they have tremendous capacity for abstracting, reasening and for creating
imaginary images, testing the same children at the age at seven years
they test out only 4% percent creative, in a period between the early
years and age seven children are continuously discorage, over and over
again from been creative and inovative, leading you imagination run ramped

Children are continuously told they that's foolish, or that's silly
they have to collor between the lines or don't touch that smell that
taste this, get in to that and children gradually learn at a deep
subconciencius leve that it's not smart to get off the between tracks
it's not smart to try look or touch or taste or feel things that mamy and
daddy don't aproved

The wondefull thing about creativity is it is subject to another
low which is called low of use, the low of use simply says: Every
human faculty we are use it or lose it, the creative faculty however
is never totally lost, what happens is there goes underground and becomes
a latent talent or capability of the humam mind, now we can begin to use
creativity again any time in life we so decide.

The propose of this course is show as how to trigger it, how stimulate it
how to get far more out it. ************** has been said that
necessity is the mother of invention and if that's so then creativity is
the father. ****** Emerson said: The we live in a lap of an imense
inteligency and he describes this imense inteligency as though is work
and ******** that surraunded earth like a huge mainframe computer into
which every one of us can tap. This has been called throught all of
history ... things like the over sool or infinity inteligency or the
universal subconciencious mind or collective uncounciencious
And we are going to talk about these aspects of human creativity
as the superconciencious mind, this superconciencious mind is so mutch
vast than our own individual inteligency and it's something we use
on a random ******* bases all the time. You'v  had the experiency
of beeng working on a problem or tring to archieve a goal
or been restling on some dilema and as you walking or driving along
and one idea shuts in your mind like a bolt and it's a perfect ideia?
Or you you'v had the examples for instance you are been thing about
someone and they telephone you, and the phone rings and it's them
or you'v called someone someone else and they say: I've just thinking
about you and just you telephone. We have examples of this all the time
where we have this almost un***** bolt from the blue that seem to
indicate that we have the ability to tap into a different form of
inteligency that anything is **** [ensinado] in textbooks

and the propose of this section is to explain how this works
because by using this superconciencious capability you find
we can dramatically improve the quality of our results and move faster
toward the archive the goals then by using any other human faculty

Ther's a book by Richard Bak called cosmic consciencieness where Bak
goes back over seven hundred years over the most creativity men and
women of all time and finds that virtualy every single one of them
spoke about inner **** ability to tap into a higher form
of concienciousness. This  superconciencious mind is caracterized by
some of the following things, first of all is the source of all
pure creativity, all great crative genius, all of great inovations
all of major breakthrouhgs in human history have come as the result
the superconcienciou functioning, some of the people who  have
written about using the superconciencious function ****** Emerson
Emerson sayd the He never wrote anything of his own foolishen
but he just simple acted as a conduit for this over sool
or this infinit inteligency and ********* through him the words
that flow out on paper word perfect. Come throug his brain almost
if he are tap into and ********* power source.

Mozart Francis  considered the gratest musician's of all time
wrote his music note perfect the first time, when he sat down
to write he said the entire music the entire sinphony the entire
opus ***** into his mind and he simple  transcribe on the papper
and people who read mozart's music even the time he was writen
said it was the most beautifull music every written down on papper
and he wrotted without corrections without changes note perfect
very first time. "Betoven (corrigir)" was death 1835 most of
his great work was written after he was totally death, and Betoven
also said that the sinphony came full blown into his mind and he
simply transcribd them on papper.

Edson, the gratest inventor the
modern age, use this superconcincious capability over and over again
to tap into a higher power and use that to camming up with inventions
insight and so on. Michael Faraday considere the father of eletromagnetic
fiel theory and an educator man who had tremendous ability to use
the superconsciencious capability and pionier the work that let
development of vacumm to by the force, which to led to radio industry,
the television industry, the eletronic industry, the transistor
micro eletronics, the microeletronic ship, the entire serie of
principles came to him in a dream, and he got up into a midle the night
and set down he wrote page after page after page of cientific formulations
which later when he take in down to the laboratory and tested where found
to be absolutelly perfeclly precise and brand new in all of human history,
they never been witten discovered or worked out before.

Every one of us has had the ocasion of using the superconciencious
creativity where we go into day to day life and we see a product or
a service and we think should be used or think that somebody should
be producing, ****** I wondering somebody does't offered that?
I wondering somebody doesn't invent that? And then two or tree or
four years later you see a major corporation comes out whit
exact the product you thought two or tree years ago, and goes on
to make milions of milions of dollars?
   The dificult with our creativity is not we do not have the same
insights tha the ginius but is the one small distintion.
The giniuses trust and belive in the value of theyr insights and in
the value of the thoughts and the ideas that come to them where's we do not
We think of ***** ... This idea can't be anything use, it came from me
it's my idea, and so we wating to see somebody else come up with the idea
***** even the idea isn't good the idea we originally had
and we say:  Ins't that person inteligent? Look off wonderfull idea
they came up with?!

Well, may all of us think there our creativity is limited by
our IQ (cociente de inteligÃªncia), creativity is limited by
education we had, or the grades we gathered on the school, that
some how creativity is something that only scientists and artists
and musicians and painters have or poets or writers. The fact
that matters is the creativity is a very simple concept:
and to boil down to simpliest words is the all creativity it is
simple a way of improving an existent way of doing things

Every creativity is an improviment into the degree to wich we have
ability to find ways to improve the way that we do things, in any
area we are creative individuals and the more we use our creativity
like the more we use the muscle the more we have.

Another caracteristic of the superconciencious capability
or the superconciencious mind is that it has access unit computs
for us, it has access to all data stored in our subconciencious mind
and it has the ability to discriminate between value and invalid
data, in another words when we program a goal or a problem into our
subconciencious mind and asks the subconciencious mind to solve it for us
the subconciencious mind passes it on to the superconciencious capability,
the superconciencious capability when it computs and calculates
to solve the problem or give us ideas to help us move toward our goal
has the ability to take all data with we take in the course in our
life time and stored in subconciencious mind and sort out from
that data what is valid and what is true and discard the rest
when it computes, thats why when every you get an idea whenever you get
this flashes came in your mind and answers a question perfectly you
will find that every single case the answer is correct in every detail

Another caracteristic of the superconciencious capability is that
brings us ideas
