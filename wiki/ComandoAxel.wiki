Parecido com o [[wget]] só que estabelece multiplas conexões agilizando os downloads

Axel is a command-line downloader for unix-like 
operating systems. Unlike wget, axel includes download 
acceleration, whicThis program tries to accelerate the 
downloading process by using multiple connections for 
one file. Starting from version 0.97, the program can 
use multiple mirrors for one download as well. The 
program tries to be as light as possible (25-30k in 
binary form), so it might be useful as a wget clone 
on byte-critical systems.

sudo apt-get install -y axel
